(Two columns, Tumor/Normal)
GT:AD:AF:ALT_F1R2:ALT_F2R1:FOXOG:QSS:REF_F1R2:REF_F2R1

GT: Genotype
AD: Allelic depths for the ref and alt alleles in the order listed
AF: Allele fraction of the event in the tumor
ALT_F1R2: Count of reads in F1R2 pair orientation supporting the alternate allele
ALT_F2R1: Count of reads in F2R1 pair orientation supporting the alternate allele
FOXOG: Fraction of alt reads indicating OxoG error
QSS: Sum of base quality scores for each allele
REF_F1R2: Count of reads in F1R2 pair orientation supporting the reference allele
REF_F2R1: Count of reads in F2R1 pair orientation supporting the reference allele
